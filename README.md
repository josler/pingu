So it goes:

### Parser

The _Parser_ takes a log line, makes an _Event_.

### Query

A _Query_ is comprised of a _Filter_, a _Grouping_, and a _Calculation_

#### Filter

Given an _Event_, does this _Event_ belong to your result set?

Decide with a set of _Rules_.

#### Grouping

Given an _Event_, how should it be categorised? How should a result be _Calculated_.
